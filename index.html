<h1>Hi! My name is Ben</h1>
<p>I am an ninth grader student at <a href = "https://www.erhsnyc.org">Eleanor Roosevelt High School</a>. Sometimes I feel like I am on the right train but the wrong track.
  Here are some things about me:
    <ol>
    <li>I'm an straight A student who takes academics sort of serious</li>
    <li>I have a quirky and laughy personality that makes people laugh, especially sienna since we are bestfriends (behind George the Gorilla).</li>
    <li>I have a lot of hobbies,including watching anime and playing and playing and playing jenga with my stuffed animals but not George because hes a bad boy (He ate my banana.)</li>
	</ol>
